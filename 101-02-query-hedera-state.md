# Module 101-02 - Querying Hedera Network State

Note that this module has already been "spiked".

## Title

Querying Hedera Network State

## Prerequisites

Assumed Knowledge

- Familiarity with command line instructions (CLI)
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and responses

Prerequisite modules

- Module 101-01 - Hedera TLDR

Software setup

- Web browser
- Github account, logged in an authenticated

## Synopsis

This module covers multiple different methods to read the current state of the Hedera network. In other words, querying its state. The methods covered are: Mirror Node APIs (programmatic), JSON-RPC (programmatic), and Hashscan (visual user interface).

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this module, students should have the following:

- explain the purpose and functionality of Mirror Nodes, JSON-RPC, and Hashscan
- compare and contrast the differences between Mirror Nodes, JSON-RPC, and Hashscan
- list the various endpoints available for JSON-RPC
- acknowledge that there is one additional method, HAPI, that will be covered in future modules

Students should also be able to perform the following practical tasks

- run a NodeJs script to query Hedera Testnet using the Mirror Node API
- run a NodeJs script to query Hedera Testnet using a JSON-RPC endpoint
- use a browser to query Hedera Testnet using Hashscan
