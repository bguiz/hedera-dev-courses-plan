# Hedera Developer Courses - Planning

## Executive Summary

The primary objective of the series of Hedera Developer Courses (101, 201, and 202 courses) is to take developers with no prior knowledge of Hedera, and equip them with the foundational skills needed to develop simple applications on Hedera. Students who have successfully completed all modules should be able to write code to interact with the Hedera network at a beginner to intermediate level of complexity.

Over the course, students are expected to appreciate what is further possible on Hedera, when using more complicated techniques and applications of the technologies. This is intended to whet their appetite for the accompanying Advanced Hedera Developer Courses (30x series of courses), for which the Hedera Developer Courses (101, 201, and 202 courses) are a prerequisite.
